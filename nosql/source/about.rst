About
=====

Warning : This project is in development and not ready for production. The documentation is a work in progress. 
The document is rather a quick reminder than a full blown manual.

I attended a course, but I learn by doing. So I decided to create a project to apply the knowledge I gained.
The project is about investing in the stock market, but also about setting up Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, ML, CI/CD, github actions and other tools.

This project's data is real stockdata. (which is messy and often incomplete, like real data) 
The data is a large json object and stored in postgres as a JSONB field. (nosql)

Different techniques, learned while attending the course, were applied.

Timeseries
----------

Stockdata is timeseries data. (sequential data with a timestamp)       
Stockdata can be considered public data, in contrast to the data of my workplace.
However, the project can be applied to other timeseries data (work related) as well.

Container (cloud)
------------------

The software was packed in Docker containers.
This allows for deployment on a Kubernetes cluster as well. (helm script provided)
The software has been deployed on Azure as well.

Visual
------- 

The data is accessible through a FASTAPI interface, and can be plotted.


Patterns
--------

As an investor, I'm interested in patterns. 
Three green periods, followed by a red one.
Reoccuring patterns, turnaround pattern ...
It would be cool to pick a certain pattern out of a haystack. (see : results)

AI model
--------

synthetic data was used to create a keras model.
The purpose is to filter out similar patterns in the database. 

It was not entirely to my liking, so I tried a few other techniques (see: results)


Cloud
-----

This was my introduction to Azure containers as well as ML studio, Azure CLI. I used the data and scripts provided, but I still had to spend a lot of time due to the steep learning curve. It is a way to construct professional ML applications, by providing building blocks. To experiment and get quick results, I used my own environment. 


K8s
---

Apart from the recommended local setup of a simple k3s cluster, I installed Talos on a server. I used virtual machines, which allowed for easy adding of clusternodes (which would normally have been real servers). Talos is really naked, or stripped down (out of security concerns) , so you need to install all the functionality yourself. I figure, if the application works on Talos, it should work on Azure, whereas the other way around ... There is an overhead, but it might prove worth while if moving away from Azure or to assure compatibility or avoid vendor locker in, or ... Another advantage might be that the cloudservices are really within your own network!  


Todo / ideas / github actions
------------------------------

Containers are really a way to get up and running quickly. Kubernetes is an extension, which might be the choice in an production environment. I have installed a containerregistry and a github repository on a local kubernetes cluster. This might enable shielding your code from unwanted eyes.  


As I noticed, changing code or training a new ML model, might trigger a lot of extra work. It would be cool if a codechange triggered the deployment of an updated container in a kubernetes cluster. I think there is a way to do this locally instead of using github actions, which publishes the containers, but then you would need another cloud service...
